This repository contains the solution of a workshop created with the aim of applying the concepts related to branching strategies

Below is the example statement that solves the logic of the workshop

## Statement
Suppose you are in the middle of a selection process at the Contoso company, and you have been asked to solve the following problem.

### Problem
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
For example, for the array **ar = [1, 2, 3]**, the result must be 6,
since **1 + 2 + 3 = 6.**

### Function Description
Implement a function called **simpleArraySum** that should return the sum of the elements
from a list as an integer.

**simpleArraySum** must have the following parameters:
* **ar:** a list of integers

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, indicating the size of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the
matrix.

### Output format
Print to the console the sum of the array elements as a single integer.

### Input Example
> 6
> 
> 1 2 3 4 10 11

### Output Example
> 31
